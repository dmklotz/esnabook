^1^ This is the treasury of Kyphi,  
  equipped with all good things,  
  with ingredients of the Eye of Horus.  
  
Great *ỉhm.w* in numerous amounts,  
  [...] in its secret form,  
  as that which goes upon his altar.  
styr[a]x on branches,[^fn-124-1]  
all resins from Punt,  
the products[^fn-124-2] of God's Land,  
  they are all in this place.  
    
How sweet is its scent!  
How great its aroma!  
Its musk brightens every face!

[^fn-124-1]: ![](images/124_2.png){width=8%} - Vadas did not read this word, but it is apparently *qmḥ.w*, "branches; leaves" (*Wb* V, 40, 2).  
[^fn-124-2]: ![](images/124_1.png){width=8%} - @vadas-2020, p.97, copied this word as *šnwt*, "offerings", but the sign is more likely *gȝ.wt  *, "bundles (of tribute)" (*Wb* V, 153, 3-7).

^2^ This is the place of wine,  
the seat of *ỉnm.t*-vintage,  
drunkennes is inside,  
rejoicing is within,  
and exaltation emerges from it.  
  
[...from S]uni,  
which comes from Imet,  
  Hut-Ihet and Kharga Oasis,  
all products of Bahariya Oasis  
  are gathered to this portal:[^fn-124-3]  
  
Joy and drunkenness are therein,  
total inebriation surrounds it!

[^fn-124-3]: @vadas-2020, p. 97, imprecisely translated this term as "sanctuary." This term has the more precise meaning of "portal" or "gateway" of a palace or temple, a place for bringing tribute, and an interface between the temple and the profane outside world; cf. @klotz-domitian, p. 69, n. g. It is thus an appropriate venue for drunken celebrations by the masses, gathered right outside before the forecourt.
