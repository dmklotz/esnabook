| How sweet is its scent!
| How great its aroma!
| Its musk brightens every face!

[^fn-124-1]: ![](images/124_2.png){width=8%} - Vadas did not read this word, but it is apparently *qmḥ.w*, "branches; leaves" (*Wb* V, 40, 2).
[^fn-124-2]: ![](images/124_1.png){width=8%} - @vadas-2020, p.97, copied this word as *šnwt*, "offerings", but the sign is more likely *gȝ.wt  *, "bundles (of tribute)" (*Wb* V, 153, 3-7).

[^fn-124-3]: @vadas-2020, p. 97, imprecisely translated this term as "sanctuary." This term has the more precise meaning of "portal" or "gateway" of a palace or temple, a place for bringing tribute, and an interface between the temple and the profane outside world; cf. @klotz-domitian, p. 69, n. g. It is thus an appropriate venue for drunken celebrations by the masses, gathered right outside before the forecourt.
