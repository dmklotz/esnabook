^1^ This hall of papyrus stalks[^fn-190-1]  
[which are in front of][^fn-190-1b]  
your majesty, Khnum,[^fn-190-2]  
the good herdsman of those on earth,  
Great Overseer of Cattle,  
numerous of livestock:  
  
It is a reed marsh,   
which you travel to behold.  
  
You harness your chariot[^fn-190-3]  
to enter it within a single night,  
and you reach Chemmis  
in the completion of a moment.[^fn-190-4]

[^fn-190-1]: ![](images/190_1.png){width=15%} - This might appear to be *s.t-ʿr.w *, "place of papyriform columns", but the following *nn* suggests we have a plural or collective noun. For the term *sʿr*, "papyrus stalk", see also [Esna 169], 9; [Esna 183], 4; @koemoth-sar, pp. 151-154.
[^fn-190-1b]: For a possible restoration, note the similar introduction to [Esna 155], 1.
[^fn-190-2]: ![](images/190_2.png){width=15%} - This trigram evokes the notion of a rising inundation, as well as the harvest month of Shomu.
[^fn-190-3]: ![](images/190_3.png){width=35%} - The verb *nḥb*, "to harness", erroneously includes the word *kȝ*, since the first group frequenly occurs in the name 'Nehebkau.'
[^fn-190-4]: An allusion to Khnum traveling between Esna and Chemmis in a single night: cf. @sauneron-1, pp. 71-72, >>sauneron-5?>>.
[^fn-190-5]: Restored after *Esna* III, 249, 4, §22

It is surroundwd with water,

their basins contain fish;  
it blossoms with plants,

It is equipped with bulls and cows,

</div>

[^fn-190-6]: Here begins a tedious list of sacred bulls and cows, and the divinities they belong to. This text continues in [Esna 155], [Esna 156], and [Esna 191]. Many of the animal terms are unique, so their precise transliteration is at times uncertain. In the following, I will only translate the names whenever the etymology seems certain. As @sauneron-2, p. 311, n. a, noted, it is dificult to distinguish the bull and cow determinatives; in what follows, I will refer to animals as "cow" or "bull" based on the feminine *t*-ending, which might not be consistent.
