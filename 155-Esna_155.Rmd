which rises upon before you,  
Khnum-Re Lord of the Field,  
Ruler of the Herdsmen;  
  
It is a reed marsh,  
which you travel to see.

[...] Manu

You reach Egypt,  
and you seize its course,  
and move all around it,  
in (the hour) She who Raises her Lord.[^fn-155-3]  
  
^2^ Chemmis bears what you love,  
a reed marsh flourishing before you.  
The *sḏm*-bulls listen (*sḏm*),   
and the *wšb*-bulls respond (*wšb*) to you;  
the cattle ranchers stay quiet  
[...] the Temple of [...][^fn-155-4]

[^fn-155-1]: What follows is another description of Khnum Lord of the Field journeying between Esna and Chemmis within a single night. Cf. [Esna 190], 1; @sauneron-1, pp. 71-72.
[^fn-155-2]: The first hour of the night: *Wb* III, 142, 10.
[^fn-155-3]: The second hour of the night: *Wb* IV, 33, 18-19.
[^fn-155-4]: @sauneron-2, p. 268, n. a, suggested a bird might be in the *ḥw.t*-sign. This could be "Temple of the Chicks", "Temple of the Mother", or something else entirely. "Temple of the Bas" is mentioned later on in column 3.

The cows and bulls(?)[^fn-155-5] are pure

You finally arrived at the land  
where you had started;  
you reach Per-Khnum in happiness,

those within Per-netjer rejoice  
from seeing you.

[^fn-155-5]: ![](images/155_1.png){width=15%} - This would appear to write "the cows of others", or "cows and other things (*nkt*)" (*Wb* II, 347, 15-16). While these options are possible, the context suggests reading the pair of "cows and bulls", with an unetymological spelling of the latter term.

[^fn-155-6]: This is often the tenth hour of the night, but it can also be the third hour of the day (*Wb* II, 160, 8-10). Since Khnum of the Field is supposed to complete his journay in a single night, the former option seems more likely here.

[he] enters [...in] happiness,  
his heart delights

Great of fowling traps,[^fn-155-8]  
prominent of blossoms,  
^4^ great of plants,  
numerous of grain.[^fn-155-9]  
Its fields[^fn-155-10] sparkle  
bearing all types of flowers.  
It is surrounded by pools  
hosting birds and fish.   
  
The stable[^fn-155-11] bears various cows,  
in all images of god.[^fn-155-12]

[^fn-155-7]: That is, North Esna is just like Chemmis, which he recently visited at night.
[^fn-155-8]: ![](images/155_2.png){width=12%} - The phonetic spelling is normal for this word, but the determinative is remarkable. It appears to show a bird above a broad net, rather than the usual clapnet used to write this term. 
[^fn-155-9]: ![](images/155_3.png){width=12%} - Same spelling of *npry*, "grain", in [Esna 176], 6.
[^fn-155-10]: The same rare term appears in [Esna 176], 5.
[^fn-155-11]: According to *Wb* II, 134, 6-8, this term usually means a granary, but here it is clearly the location for storing cows.
[^fn-155-12]: As on other texts from the front columns, here begins a list of multiple divine cows, purportedly found at Esna.

[^fn-155-12b]: Similar phrase in [Esna 95], 3.
[^fn-155-13]: Apparently there are so many calves that one could not make a full list, just as they are later said to be innumerable.
