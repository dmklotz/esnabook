The good god,  
replica of Khnum,  
living image   
of He who Weaves his Light,  
who rises for ^5^ eternity,  
who shines in the morning,  
who increases his form at night,[^fn-52-1]  
who shoots out ^6^ rays,  
who shines in the day.  
  
Plentiful of light like Akhty,  
who appears ^7^ on earth like Re,  
who shines in the sky,  
who illumines the earth with his eyes.  
The *pʿ.t*-people praise him,  
the *rekhyt* worship him,  
they all live from seeing [him],  
  
He who shines from his palace,  
of life, stability, and dominion,  
and enters the temple  
of Foremost of Neb-ankh.  
  
He is like the sundisk,  
who shines at ^10^ dawn;[^fn-52-2]  
(like) the moon, who appears  
in [...]  

</div>

[^fn-52-1]: Standard lunar epithet denoting the waxing moon.
[^fn-52-2]: ![](images/52_1.png){width=25%} - The spelling of this phrase evokes the roughly homophonous epithet *wbȝ nḥp*, "to open the potter's wheel" (i.e. start creation at dawn).

The protector gods ^11^ clear the roads for him,  
as he makes a good start  
towards the Temple of the Chicks,  
[...] the Residence of ^12^ its lord,  
Lord of gods and people:  
How joyful to see him!  
  
His august father says to him:  
'Welcome to the great place!

so you purified (my) temple,  
being cleansed, without impurity.

#### Above the Palace {-}

^13a^ *mnqb*  
  
^13a^ The palace.

^14^ Iunmutef,  
who purifies the Per-wer,  
^15^ who purifies the king  
with Upper Egyptian grains,  
who divinizes his majesty  
with *mnwr*-incense,  
^16^ who performs incense  
before the king.

#### Gods on the Standards {-}
<div class="col2">

^17^ The protector gods are united  
in protection around him,  
the protector gods show him his path,  
those upon their standards  
are performing his protection,  
the divine statues(?)[^fn-52-3] guard over him.  
  
'(Stay) here, here!  
Do not approach his path!  
Turn back, the lot of you,  
all evil-doers!  
Do not block the path from Pharaoh!'

</div>

[^fn-52-3]: ![](images/52_2.png){width=20%} - Sauneron noted the first sign (*nṯr*) could be something tall and bent, so I tentatively suggest emending to the *qmȝ* throw-stick. While this word is attested, I can find no example where it applies to the gods upon the standards.

#### Wepwaet of Upper Egypt {-}

^20^ Wepwawet of Upper Egypt  
is opening the ways for him,  
the Power of the Two Lands,  
is opening for him [...]  
[...]  
so he might see the Lord of Esna.[^fn-52-4]  

</div> 

[^fn-52-4]: ![](images/52_3.png){width=10%} - The red crown writes *n.t*, a standard value. One could possibly understand the white crown as *s* < *sḥḏ* (acrophony, frquent use of white crown in the verb *sḥḏ*, "to illumine"); *s* < *sḥn*, "double crown" (acrophony); *s* < *š* < *šmʿ*, "white crown" (acrophony, phonetic change); or *s* < *sw* < *nsw.t* (white crown writes *nsw.t*, alternates with *sw*-plant).  Alternatively, since the two crowns form a conceptual pair, one might just read "two crowns" = "the two (sisters)" = *sn.t*. Same spelling in *Esna* III, 225, 3; 241, 13 (89); 249, 2 (16); 292, 22; 385 A; *Esna* VII, 587, 31.

The Divine Falcon guards him,  
Dapple of Plumages performs his protection,  
to carry the perfection of Khnum  
within his domain.

^23^ The Mysterious [Image][^fn-52-23] guards him,  
the great young woman makes his protection,  
to kiss the earth for the Lord of Gods.  

</div>

[^fn-52-23]: For the restoration, see [Esna 74], 37 (also partially damaged); *KO* 73 and 198. In other temples, this effigy is just called "Khonsu."

#### The Ibis {-}
<div class="col2">

^24^ The August Ibis[^fn-52-24] guards his body,  
the Heart of Re encircles him,  
so he might see his [father]  
(in) his domain.

</div>

[^fn-52-24]: For the transliteration, see [Esna 74], 38.

#### The Bow {-}
<div class="col2">

^25^ *ỉwn.t wr.t ḥr dr ḫfty.w=f  *  
*pḏ.t n Rʿ ḥr bḥn sbỉ.w=f  *  
*r ḫf=f ỉt(?)=f  *  
  
The great bow is repelling his enemies,  
the bow of Re cuts down his rebels,  
so he might behold his father(?).  

</div>

#### The Ram {-}
<div class="col2">

^26^ *bȝ n šw ḥr swḏȝ ḥʿw=f  *  
*ḥr ỉr(.t) zȝ=f rʿ-nb  *  
*r mȝȝ=f ḫnty-nb-ʿnḫ  *  
   
^26^ The Ba of Shu[^fn-52-26] preserves his body,  
carrying out his protection daily,  
so he might see Foremost of Neb-ankh.  

</div>

[^fn-52-26]: In the symmetric scene ([Esna 74], 34), the ram is called Khnum the Good Protector, and "the excellent wind," both of which can be identified with Shu.
