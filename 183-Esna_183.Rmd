He fashioned a golden column,[^fn-183-3]  
for Lord of his Potter's Wheel.  
  
He transfigured a papyrus column,  
for He who Weaves his Light.  
  
He elevated a papyriform column,  
for the great ram.  
  
^5^ He [raised up] a [papyrus plant][^fn-183-4]  
for the children of Re.  
  
He elevated a plant column,  
for the great ram.  
  
He opened up a place of a canal,  
for the Companion of Maat.  
  
He promoted a *ḫnt*-plant,[^fn-183-5]  
for Foremost of Khent-ta.  
  
He raised up a tall plant,  
for the Builder of BUilders.  
  
He elevated a reed,  
for the Nurse of Nurses.  
  
He raised up a lotus column,[^fn-183-6]  
for Khnum who made the Khnums.

[^fn-183-3]: In this section, the distinctive columns are likened to papyri and other plants, just as in [Esna 162] and [Esna 169]. Like those other texts, there is very heavy use of alliteration here, and I will not point out every example. Most of the gods are epithets of Shu or Khnum, the local version of Shu, appropriate for supporting the temple roof.  
[^fn-183-4]: Restored based on alliteration, and a similar combination in [Esna 169], 6-7.
[^fn-183-5]: A very rare word for a plant, recorded once in Papyrus Vandier (*TLA* Lemma-No. 600444).
[^fn-183-6]: This term for a column occurs in a dedication inscription of Amenhotep III from Luxor Temple: *Wb* II, 294, 4.

Thus he established the floral forecourt,[^fn-183-7]  
^6^ flourishing with papyriform columns,  
shining like the sky bearing Re.  
  
^7^ They (The columns) support as Khayet,  
they lift ^8^ as Fayet,[^fn-183-8]   
bearing their lord,  
without tiring or fail.  
^9^ They raise meanwhile  
resembling the sky,  
like Shu lifting up ^10^ Nut.  
  
They remain, endure, are strong,  
like the supports underneath heaven.

[^fn-183-7]: ![](images/183_3.png){width=10%} - From the context, this must refer to the pronaos. The determinative shows this space has been transformed conceptually into a collection of plants and flowers.
[^fn-183-8]: These two goddesses, half of the divinized four "supports" of the sky, are also mentioned in [Esna 169], 10.
