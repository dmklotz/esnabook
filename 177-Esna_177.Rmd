| ^11^ [Khnum]-Re, Lord of Esna,
| Ptah who lifted up the sky,
| Shu who supports Nut,
| pillar of air [between heaven] and earth,
|    breath of life for all that is.
| 
| As he lifted up the sky upon its supports,
| he established the earth upon its plots,
| he who created all things,
|   as the product of his mind.
|   
| This Heh-god, who supports Nut,
| in his visible form
|   of He founded-the Earth 
|     through the work of his fingers.
| in his form of the Potter.
