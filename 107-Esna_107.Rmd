^1^ Esna is the land bearing the gods,  
the [good] agathos-daimon is in it,  
[...condi]tions[^fn-107-1] of the entire world.  
  
The Father in the beginning  
is building with his potter's wheel,  
beginning life for Egypt by himself.  
  
Menhyt dwells (*mn*) with him,  
never leaving [him], daily.  
  
The remote sky is Neith,  
[her son ...]  
[...] ^2^ as the sun.  
  
Her left and right eyes are the two disks.  
  
The Lord of the Field joins with his sister,  
  the north-wind,  
  making plants thrive.

[^fn-107-3]: The ancestor deities from Esna, created by Neith. Their name, *ḏȝỉs.w*, is an alternate spelling of *ṯz.w*, "utterances," hence the wordplay with the verb *ṯz*, "to lift up" here. Like the Ogdoad in Thebes, these gods apparently regulated the annual inundation of the Nile, as mentioned in [Esna 58], 2; *Esna* VI, 474.
[^fn-107-4]: ![](images/107_6.png){width=25%} - Unusual spelling that looks more like "the two Isises."
[^fn-107-5]: ![](images/107_3.png){width=10%} - This is a keyword in the theology of Khnum, and it often shows up in unorthodox, phonetic spellings. For this particular spelling with the phallus, see also [Esna 180 B]; *Esna* III, 277, 23 (8), 25 (11); 355, 3 (28), 6 (33); 371, 19; *Esna* IV, 422, 3.

[^fn-107-6]: ![](images/107_4.png){width=20%} - Reading uncertain because of the preceding damage, but this apparently refers to either Thoth or Khonsu at Esna. The same epithet in *Esna* II, 31, 43.
[^fn-107-7]: That is, Shu and Tefnut.
[^fn-107-8]: This same expression occurs in [Esna 84], 4.
[^fn-107-9]: ![](images/107_5.png){width=15%} - Note the unique spelling, which etymologically links Shemanefer to the "Great Shai" serpent.
[^fn-107-10]: Because of the lacuna, it is unclear how precisely Shemanefer is related to Imhotep. He might be his "son", or also his "likeness", "living image."
