Do not be haughty![^fn-55-2]  
Festival of Thoth.  

</div>

[^fn-55-2]: ![](images/55_2.png){width=15%} - @sauneron-5, p. 12, n. f, refrained from translating this group. Like other warnings from the Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days, this appears to be an injunction against boastful activity on this particular day. For this phrase, compare *Ptahhotep* 2, 1; 5, 8 (*m ʿȝ-ỉb=k*). @grimm, pp. 25,  240, L2, n. a, suggested "rein an Herz (?) (*m ʿbw jb*)", but that does not appear to fit the existing hieroglyphs.

[^fn-55-3]: ![](images/55_3.png){width=15%} - @sauneron-5, pp. 11-12, n. g, emended this to "Priere (?) devant son visage (*sns m ḥr=f*)," while @grimm, pp 25, 241, L3, n. g, read "Rufen vor dem Gesicht(?) (*njs m ḥr(?)*)." The present translation requires no correction, understanding a set phrase: *Wb* III, 128, 1.

[^fn-55-5]: Apparently an allusion to Apophis and other enemies of Re who emerged from Atum's. If they are indeed serpents, they appear to be identified here with intestines (also *ỉmy.w-ẖ.t*). For the signifiance of this verb (*wḏʿ*), see Corteggiani, BIFAO 95; for the Heliopolitan mythology here, see @meeks-delta.
<!--Note the original reading by Junker, Auszug, p. 71, appears to make more sense: "um die Eingeweide abzuschneiden(?)" (Cited by Grimm, p. 243, L10, n. e) -->
