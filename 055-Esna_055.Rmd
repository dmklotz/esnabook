[^fn-55-2]: ![](images/55_2.png){width=15%} - @sauneron-5, p. 12, n. f, refrained from translating this group. Like other warnings from the Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days, this appears to be an injunction against boastful activity on this particular day. For this phrase, compare *Ptahhotep* 2, 1; 5, 8 (*m ʿȝ-ỉb=k*). @grimm, pp. 25,  240, L2, n. a, suggested "rein an Herz (?) (*m ʿbw jb*)", but that does not appear to fit the existing hieroglyphs.

[^fn-55-5]: Apparently an allusion to Apophis and other enemies of Re who emerged from Atum's. If they are indeed serpents, they appear to be identified here with intestines (also *ỉmy.w-ẖ.t*). For the signifiance of this verb (*wḏʿ*), see Corteggiani, BIFAO 95; for the Heliopolitan mythology here, see @meeks-delta.

</div>

[^fn-55-12]: ![](images/55_6.png){width=10%} - @sauneron-5, pp. 17-18, with n. c, thought the first sign was a mistake for the di-bread loaf: "Assurer (*ḏỉ.t*) l'union au disque"; @grimm, pp. 73, 250, L41, preferred *zḫn*, "Sichereignen des Sichvereinigens." However, neither expressions occur elsewhere in the Esna calendar. Rather, this resembles similar spellings of the triangular *ḏbȝ* sign at Esna, where it very closely resembles negative arms. For example, above in a similar calendar entry for [Thoth 10]: ![](images/55_6b.png){width=8%}; or in the word *ḏbȝ.t*, "coffin": [Esna 129], 4: ![](images/55_6c.png){width=10%}; cf. @sauneron-2, p. xxviii.

[^fn-55-15]: ![](images/55_7.png){width=35%} - The reading is uncertain; cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 19, n. e, Corrigenda, A. Rather than introduce a festival of an otherwise unknown "Min Lord of Sais", I propose to read the Min figure as a preposition (*n/m* < *Mnw*), since he represents *m* elsewhere at Esna. A similar festival procession of Neith, where she appears with her bow, is described in [Esna 63], 1-2, apparently associated with Meshir 16.
