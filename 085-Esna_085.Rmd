[...]  
[...] the Temple of the Mother.  
The Mother of God is great therein,  
Her throne, where she stays in Upper Egypt,  
more distinguished than the sky  
  bearing the two disks.  
   
She rises within it  
  as if she were in heaven,[^fn-85-1]  
she appears in procession at her season  
  in her form of the Archer,  
in her ^2^ good festival, the Festival of Neith  
[...]

[^fn-85-1]: Similar phraseology describing Neith's procession in the symmetric text, [Esna 64],1.

[...] great,  
her altar is heavy with offerings,  
her chambers are equipped with linen,  
her palace is stocked with *ỉbr*-unguent.  
    
Nothing is found to be missing in her temple,  
until the end of eternity.  
  
Thus *Mḥ-n.t* is the name of the [shrine]  [^fn-85-2]  
  on the left of every temple  
    until this very day.

</div>

[^fn-85-2]: It's unclear what etymology is being referred to here. Possibly the preceding statements about how Neith's temple chapels are "filled (*mḥ*)" with all good things?

[...] sees [...]  
[...] she [...] within the sky,  
her Ennead on the right and left,  
  like the stars in her following.  
    
Her son Re is the sun within her,  
being pregnant in order to birth him  
  every day,  
^4^ he enters[^fn-85-3] the Temple of Neith  
in order to see his mother,  
and his heart rejoices  
from seeing his two children.  
  
How scintillating is this good forecourt!  
How much greater it is  
than what was there before!  
  
Inscribed with all writings,  
carved in the great name (of the king),  
equipped and made sacred with [its] contents,  
magnifying the prestige of the Mother of God,  
along with her Ennead,  
for ever and for all eternity.

[^fn-85-3]: ![](images/85_1.png){width=10%} - The serpent appears to be serving double duty as the verb *and* the suffix pronoun. Alternatively, this could be a participle in apposition to Re: "He who enters the temple of Neith..."
