^1^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt  
(Autokrator Titus Caesar)|  
^2^ Son of Re  
(Vespa(s)ian Augustus)|  
  
^3^ [...]  
[...(Autok]rator Titus Caesar)|  
I have come before you,  
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna.[^fn-54-1]  
  
I bring to you all good things  
which come forth from Hapi,  
verdure, ^4^ plants.  
  
I tour the marshes  
in the Good Field:[^fn-54-2]  
many birds,  
numerous mixed geese.  
  
I round up[^fn-54-3] the goodness  
of the First Cataract region (Qebehu).  
  
You are the lord of gods and people,  
who created what exists,  
lord of millions, numerous of myriads.  

</div>

[^fn-54-1]: ![](images/54_1.png){width=15%} - This spelling recalls the etymology narrated in [Esna 81], 1-2.
[^fn-54-2]: "Touring the marshes" has various connotations, but here it refers to the Egyptian pasttime of enjoying flowers and natural life. The healthy, "Good Field" is produced when Nebtu-Isis returns to North Esna: cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 59-60.
[^fn-54-3]: *Wb* V, 321, 10. Several of the rare phrases from this scene, including this verb, occur in the offering scene *Esna* III, 218.

#### First Hapi {-}

^5^ Hapi of Upper Egypt,  
^6^ flooded bearing his goodness.  
  
^7^ Recitation:  
The Son of Re,  
(Vespa(s)ian Augustus)|  
has come before you,  
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna.[^fn-54-4]  
  
He brings to you a rejuvenated Hapi,  
who comes forth from the caverns  
as a heavy(?) [...]  
^8^ Great Nun who settles at his time,  
who swallows the two lands  
with his efflux.  
  
You are He who stands on his legs,  
Lord of steps in Ta-Seti,  
spitting out Nun  
in order to [re]new food shares  
for the entire land.

</div>

[^fn-54-4]: ![](images/54_2.png){width=25%} - The spelling of Khnum evokes the rising (*ḫy*) of Nun (child + canal). The first two signs of Esna (land + phallus = *s* < *sṯỉ*) by themselves could write Ta-Seti, anticipating the reference to Khnum in Ta-Seti (column 8), spitting out or ejaculating (both *sṯỉ*) Nun from the South.

^9^ Rejuvenated Water,  
^10^ it filled the fields.  
  
^11^ Words spoken:  
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt  
([Auto]krator Titus Caesar)|  
[has] come before you,  
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna.  
  
He brings to you the rejuvenated water,  
which comes forth from the First Cataract,  
which arrives at [its] time,  
^12^ offerings and provisions  
follow after him,  
presenting them to your Ka, daily.  
  
You are the Ba, image of Atum,[^fn-54-5]  
lord of what is,  
who enlivens what exists.

</div>

[^fn-54-5]: ![](images/54_3.png){width=20%} - The same spelling of Atum occurs in [Esna 67], 12; [Esna 163], 13; *Esna* III, 218, 9.

#### Third Hapi {-}

The *ʿḏ*-region,  
he equipped your *ỉp.t*-fields,  
so he might decorate (your) altar.[^fn-54-6]  
  
^15^ Words spoken:  
The Son of Re  
(Vespasian Augustus)|  
has come before you,  
Khnum-Re Lord of E[sna].  
  
He brings to you the *ʿḏ*-region of Esna,  
breads ^16^ are in front of him,  
all his lips(?)   
are 'wood-of-life',  
sparkling from all the marshes.  
  
You are Khnum, [Lord] of the Field (*ww*),  
breath of life for gods and people,  
your goodness improves those on earth.

</div>

[^fn-54-6]: ![](images/54_4.png){width=8%} - Sauneron arranged the signs differently in the text edition, but I read the two tall signs as *wȝḏ* + *ḥ* = *wḏḥW*, followed by the elaborate determinative. It's unclear whether the two small signs were meant to signify the expected suffix pronoun (*=k*).
