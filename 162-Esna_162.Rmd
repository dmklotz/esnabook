He erected her temple,  
enduring upon its foundation,  
her chapel in the location it had been;[^fn-162-2]  
a hypostyle hall in front of it,  
in order to sancitfy its fourecourt,  
and enclosure walls encircling it all.  
  
It is complete in its work,  
equipped with statues,  
and finished in all its requirements.  
  
He fashioned a vessel of silver  
within [...] gold,  
as a processional [bark?...]  
[...]  
all [necessary things]  
for performing sacred rituals.

[^fn-162-2]: Apparently the naos of Neith was in its original, Pharaonic location, but the surviving pronaos was an extension.

He illumined her temple

[^fn-162-5]: Here begins a long list of fanciful designations for the papyriform columns in the pronaos, most equated with different terms for papyrus or lotus plants; a similar section occurs in [Esna 183], 4-5. As in similar texts from these columns, there is heaven alliteration between the construction verb, the name for the column, and the god -- this alliteration will not be pointed out below, but it should usually be apparent in the corresponding transliteration.  The gods are usually forms of Shu, the god who supports the sky just like the columns; occasionally they are forms of Khnum, Esna's local version of Shu.
@leitz-2014, p. 1036 noted that between this text and [Esna 183], there appear to be 23 distinct columns called out here, only one less than the total 24 columns of the pronaos.
[^fn-162-5a]: ![](images/162_2.png){width=9%} - Reading uncertain, but likely based on the alliteration.
[^fn-162-5b]: For this term, see also [Esna 169], 3.
[^fn-162-5bb]: This is also an epithet of Shu: *LGG* VI, 310b-c.
[^fn-162-5c]: This is a popular epithet of Shu: *LGG* VI, 210b-c; also [Esna 176], 1.
[^fn-162-5d]: Restored based on alliteration, with the same term *ʿr* in [Esna 183], 5.
[^fn-162-5dd]: ![](images/162_4.png){width=12%} - Note the use of *nfr* to write *n=f* (< *nfr*) for the verbal form; cf. @sauneron-1, p. 48, n. 1.
[^fn-162-5e]: ![](images/162_3.png){width=10%} - For this spelling, see also [Esna 127], 5.
[^fn-162-5f]: For this term, see @sauneron-bifao64, p. 2; [Esna 176], 7.

Thus he established the pronaos,  
bearing the columns:  
bright like heaven,  
illumined like the earth.  
  
Without shaking,  
without collapsing,  
remaining, enduring, solid,  
in this earth, forever.
