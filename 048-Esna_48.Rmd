Re is seen within as an august child,

He unites with his father, Tatenen,

That one[^fn-48_2] (Khnum-Tatenen) is the virile one,   
he who creates sexual pleasure,    
the engendering ram with four faces,[^fn-48_5]

As he illumined the Temple of the Father   
      by his coming forth,

   so that the field is overlaid[^fn-48_3] with gold dust.

Great god, Lord of the Field.

[^fn-48_1]: The festival of "lifting up heaven" on Phamenoth 1 is widely attested since the New Kingdom, and most frequently involves the Memphite demiurge Ptah-Tatenen; cf. @berlandini-1995, pp. 29-31. At Esna, this coincided with the major festival of installing the potter's wheel by Khnum-Re-Tatenen: @sauneron-5, pp. 71-88, 81-244; @leitz-loeffler.  
  
[^fn-48_2]: The text still seems to describe the union between the solar god (*pw* = Khepri), and his father, the demiurge and procreator (*pfy*  = Tatenen). Nonetheless, Khnum is elsewhere called explicitly *wsn pfy*: [Esna II, 17], 6-7; [Esna III, 249], 2; similarly [Esna II, 184], 12; cf. @pichel pp. 22-23, n. i.  
  
[^fn-48_5]: Reference to the quadrifrontic ram of Mendes, composed of Re, Shu, Geb, and Osiris. They are explicitly labelled elsewhere in [Esna II, 17], 46-49; [Esna III, 250], 16-17; [Esna III, 232], 6; separate depictions of them in [Esna II 140]. Cf. @pichel, pp. 76-79. The Mendesian ram frequently receives these same virile epithets, as well as Khnum at Esna.  
  
[^fn-48_6]: For Khnum "foremost of Neb-ankh", see also [Esna II, 52], 26; *Esna* VII, 577, 5 (epithet of Khnum Lord of the Field).  
  
[^fn-48_3]: Not listed in dictionaries (![](images/48_1.png){width=10%}), @sauneron-61, p. 233, compared this to Coptic ⲉⲓⲉⲗⲉⲗ, "to shine" (Crum, *CD* 77 ). However, this seems to be the same hieroglyphic word *rr* which occurs in divine epithets such as *rr m nbw*, "overlaid with gold". It might be related to Demotic *lʿlʿ*, Coptic ⲗⲁⲗⲉ: @klotz-philae, pp. 91-93, n. m.  
  
[^fn-48_4]: Yet another reference to constructing a firmament (*hȝy.t*), this section appears to refer again to Tatenen, one aspect of Khnum-Re. The god Amun-Re is frequently praised for establishing all regions of the cosmos (cf. *Deir Chelouit* III, 125, 8-9).
