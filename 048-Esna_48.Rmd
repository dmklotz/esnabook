^A^ Re is seen within as an august child,    
   who is born in the morning.    
He unites with his father, Tatenen,    
   after he (Tatenen) lifted up the sky [bear]ing him,    
       on III Peret ([Phamenoth 1]).

That one[^fn-48_2] (Khnum-Tatenen) is the virile one,   
he who creates sexual pleasure,    
the engendering ram with four faces,[^fn-48_5]

As he illumined the Temple of the Father

Great god, Lord of the Field.

[^fn-48_2]: The text still seems to describe the union between the solar god (*pw* = Khepri), and his father, the demiurge and procreator (*pfy*  = Tatenen). Nonetheless, Khnum is elsewhere called explicitly *wsn pfy*: [Esna II, 17], 6-7; [Esna III, 249], 2; similarly [Esna II, 184], 12; cf. @pichel pp. 22-23, n. i.  
  
[^fn-48_5]: Reference to the quadrifrontic ram of Mendes, composed of Re, Shu, Geb, and Osiris. They are explicitly labelled elsewhere in [Esna II, 17], 46-49; [Esna III, 250], 16-17; [Esna III, 232], 6; separate depictions of them in [Esna II 140]. Cf. @pichel, pp. 76-79. The Mendesian ram frequently receives these same virile epithets, as well as Khnum at Esna.  
  
[^fn-48_6]: For Khnum "foremost of Neb-ankh", see also [Esna II, 52], 26; *Esna* VII, 577, 5 (epithet of Khnum Lord of the Field).  
  
[^fn-48_3]: Not listed in dictionaries (![](images/48_1.png){width=10%}), @sauneron-61, p. 233, compared this to Coptic ⲉⲓⲉⲗⲉⲗ, "to shine" (Crum, *CD* 77 ). However, this seems to be the same hieroglyphic word *rr* which occurs in divine epithets such as *rr m nbw*, "overlaid with gold". It might be related to Demotic *lʿlʿ*, Coptic ⲗⲁⲗⲉ: @klotz-philae, pp. 91-93, n. m.  
  
[^fn-48_4]: Yet another reference to constructing a firmament (*hȝy.t*), this section appears to refer again to Tatenen, one aspect of Khnum-Re. The god Amun-Re is frequently praised for establishing all regions of the cosmos (cf. *Deir Chelouit* III, 125, 8-9).

He (sic) announced for him  
light for those who exist,  
the sundisk shines,  
his image goes up [...] heaven,

Osiris is buried in Per-netjer,  
with the great Djaisu of Mehet-weret,  
who are concealed in the cavern.  
People cannot see it,  
gods cannot know it,  
the whole world is pure   
from its abomination.  
  
Isis, the mistress,  
performs cool water and incense for their Ka,  
along with the blessed dead.

Maat came down from heaven to Re,  
and made her seat in this land,  
gods and goddesses assemble to see her.  
  
The mother and father in the beginning,  
who began creation, before creation existed,  
all creation came into existence  
after they came into existence.  
  
She is the mother of Re,  
as she enters her domain  
her heart is glad.  
  
Neith the great, Mother of God,  
Lady of Esna.  
Menhyt-Nebtu ruler in Per-netjer.
