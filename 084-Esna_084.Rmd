[...the work of] his [hands?] [^fn-84-1] 
settles nomes and cities.  

Then Re said to his [son], Shu:  
"May you go [...]  
you [...] the area of every god for him."  
  
They went upstream to the southern cities,  
  to where the Mother of God (Neith) was,  
That is: the South City (*Rs-n.t*).[^fn-84-2]  
  
Then Shu said to Re:  
"This place is the land of [...]"

[^fn-84-1]: Tentative restoration based on [Esna 61], 1 and 6-7; [Esna 177], 11.

[^fn-84-2]: Although the syntax is unconventional, there appears to be a pun on the "southern city" (i.e. Esna) and the *Rs-n.t* chapel of Neith.

Thus one [says Khent]-ta  
   as the name of this district;[^fn-84-3]  
     
Khonsu and Thoth [^fn-84-4] came about in this place  
   for the Festival of Fury [^fn-84-5]  
     within this temple for that reason,  
   until today.  
   
</div>

[^fn-84-3]: Restoration suggested by @sauneron-2, p. 181, n. a. Presumably, Shu's damaged speech that began mentioning a "land (*tȝ*)" also mentioned the term *ḫnt* or a homophone.

[^fn-84-4]: @sauneron-2, p. 181, n. a., noted the names **Khon**su and **Tho**th acrophonically evoke the name of **Khent-ta**.

[^fn-84-5]: The "moment of fury" is mentioned in relation to Neith in [Esna 102], 2. It's unclear which actual festival from the calendar at Esna this corresponds to.

[^fn-84-6]: ![](images/84_1.png){width=35%} - The precise negative adjective of the heart is unclear, but it clearly contrasts with *snb-ỉb* mentioned next.
