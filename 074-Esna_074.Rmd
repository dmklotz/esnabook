[^fn-74-2]: The following hymn for giving incense to the uraeus occurs was part of the Daily Statue Ritual and the Ritual of Opening the Mouth, and as such it appears many times in temple scenes from the New Kingdom onwards. In the Graeco-Roman period, it frequently occurs in scenes like the present one, where the king emerges from the palace, being simultaneously protected and purified from incense. For many examples, see @kurth-edfu7, p. 344, n. 4; @thiers-tanent, pp. 314-315, n. ad; @cauville-noms, pp. 45-46. These variants enable the minor restorations throughout the present version.
[^fn-74-3]: Menhyt, the goddess of Esna represented in this scene, is mentioned in most examples of this text going back to the New Kingdom.
[^fn-74-3b]: ![](images/74_2.png){width=15%} - As @sauneron-bifao64, pp. 4-5, demonstrated, this spelling of *tȝy.t* is based on confusion of similar hieratic groups.
[^fn-74-4]: The "bend" or "coil" here refers to the curly part of the red crown.
[^fn-74-4b]: ![](images/74_3.png){width=8%} - *sḥḏ*, "to illumine" < *s(r)*, "ram" + *ḥḏ(.t)*, "white crown."
[^fn-74-5]: This is the pointy part of the red crown (Meeks, *AL* I, 1657; see [Projet Karnak](http://sith.huma-num.fr/vocable/1673)). Not to be confused with *mỉz.wt*, "white crown" (*Wb* II, 44, 15-16).

[^fn-74-6]: ![](images/74_4.png){width=22%} - This phonetic variant sportively alludes to the first god on a standard (a ram, Khnum the Good Protector), and the royal Ka which usually accompanies the king in such scenes.

[^fn-74-8]: ![](images/74_5.png){width=15%} - Unusual spelling of *mỉ.t*, "path." The medial diphthong (cf. Coptic ⲙⲟⲉⲓⲧ) seems to have been rendered by the uniliteral *f*, for which one might compare spellings of Arsin***oe*** in hieroglyphs, where the final diphthong appears as *nf*: @quaegebeur-jnes, pp. 260-261.
