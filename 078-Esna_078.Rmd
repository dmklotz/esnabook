Live [the good god]  
[the youth], beautiful in his form,  
double plumes on his head,  
Menhyt[^fn-78-1] on his brow,  
in his form of Khnum,  
father of the gods.[^fn-78-2]  
  
Processing from the palace,  
setting on the path,[^fn-78-3]  
the two Lords receive [him],[^fn-78-4]  
they establish his limits,  
the introduce him [...]  
[upon] the [r]oad  
to see their mother (Neith).  
  
He opens her shrine,  
in great sanctity,  
he finds her Majesty,  
and her Ennead is pleased at heart.  
  
He sees [...]  
establishes his [...] on earth, forever.

[^fn-78-1]: ![](images/78_1.png){width=15%}- Note the spelling of 'Menhyt' as *mn-ḫt*.
[^fn-78-2]: Descriptions of the king leaving the palace, as in [Esna 52] and [Esna 74], in which he wears the double plumes of Khnum, with a uraeus (Menhyt) on his brow. Similar text in [Esna 56].
[^fn-78-3]: Direction quotation of [Esna 74], 6.
[^fn-78-4]: These two Lords are presumably Thoth and Harsiese (cf. [Esna 56]), who purify the king in [Esna 67], and introduce him to Khnum in [Esna 88].
