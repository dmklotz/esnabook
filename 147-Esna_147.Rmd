NB: As Sauneron noted in the original edition, very similar parallels exist in *KO* 325; 423, 1-2; *Philä* I, 279. These variants help to confirm certain readings.

As the sky is estbalished upon its supports;  
as the earth is stable upon its foundations;  
as Khnum-Re shines in the day bark,  
  his rays illumiing the two lands;  
as the moon shines in the night;  
as Orion is the Ba of Osiris[^fn-147-1],  
  Sothis as Ruler of the Decan stars,  
  the temple bearing their statues;  
as the Inundation arrives at his time,  
  [the lan]d [s]pits out its plants,  
  that which Isis did remains for Osiris,  
  the mountains remaining in their places;  
    
Then the temple of Neith remains[^fn-147-2] forever,  
  the son of Re, (Domitian Augustus),  
  King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
    is upon his throne, eternally.
