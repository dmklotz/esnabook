[^fn-146-1]: Special form of Hathor's child, Ihy. Cf. @cauville-ihy.  
[^fn-146-2]: ![](images/146_1.png){width=8%} - Reading suggested by @sauneron-2, p. xxxi; see also @kurth-1, p. 210, n. 121.  
[^fn-146-3]: ![](images/146_2.png){width=15%} - This spelling of Esna alludes to the two children of Re, Khnum-Shu and Nebtu-Tefnut. Compare a similar spelling of these "two children" in [Esna 58], 3: ![](images/146_5.png){width=12%}; similarly [Esna 80], 1.  
[^fn-146-4]: ![](images/146_3.png){width=10%} -  Tentatively restoring the name of Tefnut, as in [Esna 60], 5: ![](images/146_4.png){width=10%} (*Tfn.t* < *tf*, "to spit" + *niw.t*, "city)  
[^fn-146-5]: That is, Khnum-Shu Lord of the Field, and Heka-Geb. Exact parallel to this phrase in *Esna* III, 236, 10, right after Menhyt returns to Egypt from Kenset.
