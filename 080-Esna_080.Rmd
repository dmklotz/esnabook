^1^ [...Neith....] Re,  
they rejuvenated[^fn-80-0] within it,  
they rested there,  
when Re gave birth to them.  
  
The legs of his majesty were set,  
along with their majesties,[^fn-80-1]  
towards (going to) this mound,  
since it is the city  
of the Lord of Life.

[^fn-80-0]: ![](images/80_0.png){width=20%} - @sternberg, p. 92, n. b, translated *ḥwn.wy=sn*, "ihre Sprößlinge".
This translation is based on the parallel in *Esna* II, 31, 60 (not mentioned by Sternberg), also concerning Re and Neith: "they rejuvenated their bodies in the form of the children of Re (*ḥwnw ḏ.t=sn m ṯȝ.wy n Rʿ*)"; cf. @pichel, p. 136.
[^fn-80-1]: Shu and Tefnut.

Then Re said to Shu and Tefnut:  
You shall stay here   
^2^ [...]  
[...]  
[You] are as an air-pillar of life,  
[your] sister [...]  
it is your [...] since the beginning.  
  
Thus one says 'Iun' as the name of Shu,  
and 'Iunyt' as the name of this district.

Their mother, Neith, nursed them

[^fn-80-2]: Possibly understanding an allusion to Shu and Tefnut as the two baby crocodiles nursed by Neith, as in [Esna 104], 7 (*ỉw=sn m sbk.wy*)
[^fn-80-2b]: Restored based on the parallel in *Esna* II, 31, 39; for Shu and Tefnut as the two disks, see also [Esna 81], 6; *Esna* III, 346, 22.

Re rises just to see them,  
every day.  
  
He unites with them  
as the Ba amidst his chicks,[^fn-80-4]  
thus 'Mound of the Chicks' came about  
as the name of this mound.  
</div>

[^fn-80-3]: ![](images/80_1.png){width=35%} - This is a reference to Thoth in North Esna; cf. @klotz-baboons, p. 38, n. b.  Based on the examples in *Esna* III, 309, 27, and *Esna* VI, 493, 9, the two birds here write *sn.wy*, "the two (siblings)" (i.e. Shu and Tefnut), and not *bȝ.wy* (contra @sternberg, p. 83, n. o).
[^fn-80-4]: Similar narrative, from "one of the three" to "Ba amidst his chicks" in *Esna* II, 31, 62-63.
