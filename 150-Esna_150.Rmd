| ^2^ [...child] of the Greatest of Magic[^fn-150-2],
| Lord of justification,
| who was recognized already in the womb,
|   before he had come forth [on earth...],
| whom Shai [distinguished] upon the birth-brick,
| to whom the Two Ladies gave [^fn-150-3] their breasts
|   during his breakfast,[^fn-150-4]
| whom the birth-goddesses distinguished
|   while still atop his swaddling clothes.
| 
| Egypt is flooded during his era,
| the King of Upper and Lower Egypt,
| Lord of the Two Lands,[^fn-150-5] 
| (Autokrator Ca[esar])|
| *beloved of*
| Heka the Child,
| the very great, first-born of Khnum,
| good child,
| who repeats births in Upper and Lower Egypt.

[^fn-150-1]: ![](images/150_1.png){width=20%} - Common sportive writing of this verb, with the sun as Khnum shining between heaven and earth.
[^fn-150-2]: ![](images/150_2.png){width=15%}![](images/150_3.png){width=5%} - The determinative appears to be Osiris, which makes it tempting to read the preceding signs as an elaborate, acrophonic trigram for his name. Nonetheless, this seems more likely to be a representation of Geb, who like Heka could be called "greatest of magic", and whose connection to magic is well-known.
[^fn-150-3]: ![](images/150_4.png){width=15%} - Rare spelling of this common verb.
[^fn-150-4]: ![](images/150_5.png){width=15%} - Notable spelling of this word for "breakfast" (*Wb* IV, 350, 5-6). Due to the lacuna, it's unclear if a preposition is missing ("as/for his breakfast"), so the present translation assumes the mealtime is being used adverbially.
[^fn-150-5]: ![](images/150_6.png){width=12%}![](images/150_7.png){width=10%} - The same spelling occurs in a damaged context in [Esna 146], 2. The ram (*bȝ*) with the red crown (*n*) writes *nb*.
