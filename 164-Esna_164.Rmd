Live the good god,  
who shines [^fn-164-1] (over) Esna [^fn-164-2],  
who illumines [^fn-164-3] the Temple of the Bas,  
who protects the Nome of the Chicks,  
like Re, for all eternity.

[^fn-164-1]: For similar spellings of *wbn* featuring a ram, cf. @klotz-baboons, p. 34, n. b.  
  
[^fn-164-2]: Heka writes *tȝ*, "earth", since he wears the special crown of Geb (@klotz-baboons, pp. 50-51, n. b; for Heka-Geb, see @klotz-baboons, p. 40). Sobek writes *s* via acrophony; cf. also [Esna 185 A]. Similar writings of Esna with Geb, Sobek, and Neith occur in *Esna* III, 318, 11; IV, 463, S; 464, N; 465, N; cf. also *Esna* III, 378, 23; IV, 461, S (just Geb and Neith). @kurth-1, p. 533, n. 4, suggested some of these examples cannot derive from Sobek, since the crocodile looks more like Shemanefer, but the distinction is dubious since Shemanefer himself is often called "Sobek." <!--is this true?-->  
  
[^fn-164-3]: *s(r)*, "ram" + *ḥḏ*, "white crown". This spelling echoes *wbn* at the beginning of the text.

Lord of wonders,   
who foretells [^fn-164-4] what will come,  
great sovereign among the gods,  
lord of rejoicing,  
  one rejoices to see him:  
Heka (![](images/164_2.png){width=20%}):[^fn-164-5]  
ruler in Egypt.  
  
</div>  
  
[^fn-164-6]: The same epithet occurs in the litany to Heka, *Esna* III, 242, 25 (75), the first indication this entire text is about him (see below).  
  
[^fn-164-4]: ![](images/164_3.png){width=8%} - The spelling of this participle is notable, Anubis playing a tambourine, iconography discussed by Ritner and Von Lieven. This apparently derives from s(h)r, to "strike a drum" (>>refs>>), and relates to the phrase sr-biAy.t, "to foretell wonders", used in a musical sense (ref. to H.G. Fischer). In his litany, Heka is similarly "lord of wonders" and "he who foretells what will come to pass (*sr ḫpr*)" (Esna III, 242, 18 (19)-(20); cf. also *Esna*)  
<!--to do: add refs. to Ritner, Von Lieven; check LGG and PWL for sr,shr-->.  
[^fn-164-5]: *ḥ* < *ḥȝy*, "to shine" (@sauneron-8, p. 160); *kȝ* < *qȝ*. The same spelling of Heka occurs in *Esna* III, 242, 20 (33), shortly before the same epithet as here, "one rejoices to see him": *Esna* III, 242, 20 (34); the signs are inverted in *Esna* III, 242, 22 (48).
