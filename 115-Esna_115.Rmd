The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,

</div>  
  
[^fn-115-1]: The same Hapi shows up in *Esna* VI, 539, 58-61 (14). His name appears to mean "the flood that revises at his moment," perhaps a reference to territorial boundaries requiring new inspections after the annual Inundation.  
[^fn-115-2]: ![](images/115_2.png){width=15%} - The spelling of Khnum alludes to the prominent belly of Hapi, while the second two signs are aquatic.  Same spellings in *Esna* III, 211, 18; 294, 12; *Esna* VII, 628, 5.  
[^fn-115-3]: These are the two categories of Egyptian fields: cf. @meeks-donations, pp. 56, n. 18; 147-148.  
[^fn-115-4]: For the meaning of this epithet, cf. @gabolde-1995.

</div>  
  
[^fn-115-5]: Lit. "the field who is bent over (from the weight of) carrying her products." A divinized field with a similar name (but without *ks*) appears in *Esna* VI, 539, 30-33 (7).  
[^fn-115-6]: ![](images/115_1.png){width=8%}  - The baboon sign elsewhere writes *ḏd-mdw* (@kurth-1, p. 204, No. 103). Since it refers to grain here, I tentatively suggest this is *ḏdȝ* (baboon = *ḏd*), tall bread sign = *dȝ* < *dỉ*), "to be fat." @elgawady, p. 210, n. 1519, suggested reading this sign as *spd*, "ausgestattet mit/versehen mit," i.e. *s* (baboon) + *spd*. 
[^fn-115-7]: Shai was an agathos daimon serpent, connected with food products. I don't know of parallels for this epithet, but Khnum is elsewhere "the Ka serpent who made Kas."  
[^fn-115-8]: For this divine and royal epithet related to fields and food production, cf. @inconnu.
