| as [^fn-142-1] the King of Upper and Lower Egypt ( )|[^fn-142-2]
| Gods and goddesses [do ...]
|   for his Ka in happiness,
| because of what Re himself said.[^fn-142-3]
| 
| Khnum-Re, Lord of Esna:
| May you enter it,
| and shine within it,
|   to issue commands to its citizens.
|   
| As it remains bearing your Ba,
| it endures [bearing your secret image?] [^fn-142-4]
| [...] eternally.

[^fn-142-1]: This inscription begins with a prepositional phrase, and apparently continues one of the texts from the related scene [Esna 141].
[^fn-142-2]: Empty cartouche, but does not make sense to translate as "name" or "titulary".
[^fn-142-3]: Allusion to the standard "Decree of Re" granting the king, and Horus, legitimate rule over Egypt. Cf. @derchain-1995, pp. 93-97.
[^fn-142-4]: Restoration suggested by similar phrases at Esna.
