^1^ The good god,  
who elevates heaven for his mother,  
in her favorite place,  
like Shu, elevating[^fn-169-1] the sky,  
lifting up the Place of Re   
for the Mother of Re,  
in order to move about therein,  
supporting its four corners[^fn-169-2],  
establishing the supports beneath it,  
making it endure for her name [^fn-169-3],  
like the sky bearing [the moon].[^fn-169-4]  
  
[...] her [...] among the gods(?),[^fn-169-5]  
(Since) all eyes are stunned[^fn-169-6]  
from fear of her:  
he concealed the image of his mighty mother.

[^fn-169-1]: ![](images/169_1.png){width=20%} - Unique spelling with acrophonic *w* < *wȝḥ* (cf. @sauneron-8, p. 183).
[^fn-169-2]: ![](images/169_2a.png){width=8%}![](images/169_2b.png){width=8%} - Notable spelling.
[^fn-169-3]: See the correction to the printed hieroglyphs in @sauneron-2, p. i.
[^fn-169-4]: Restored after a similar phrase in *Esna* II, 30, 2.
[^fn-169-5]: ![](images/169_4a.png){width=10%}![](images/169_4b.png){width=15%} - The crocodiles could write something else, but presumably this is an epithet about Neith's "power/prestige/respect" being great among the gods.
[^fn-169-6]: For the spelling of this verb at Esna, see @sauneron-61, pp 240-241.

Khnum,[^fn-169-7] air-pillar (*ỉwn*) of life.   

</div>

[^fn-169-7a]: The following text identifies the papyriform columns of the pronaos with various types of plants, primarily papyrus or other reeds. There are many examples of alliteration.
[^fn-169-7]: ![](images/169_5.png){width=25%} - Spelling of Khnum.

in your forecourt.  

</div>

[^fn-169-8a]: ![](images/169_7.png){width=10%} - This term does not appear to be in dictionaries, but seems to designate a column capital; it also occurs in [Esna 162], 5. Perhaps related to *šnʿ*, "storm cloud" because of its appearance?
[^fn-169-8]: ![](images/169_6.png){width=25%} - Uncertain. The preceding spelling of *ḫft-ḥr* with a child suggests the present reading.

[^fn-169-11]: ![](images/169_10.png){width=15%} - This word occurs several times. It appears to be the normal word "tree", but the determinative suggests general flora; as below, line 9. In *Esna* III, 392, 20, it appears to be part of a tree that shakes with Khnum's force (@sauneron-5, p. 203, left this word untranslated).
[^fn-169-12]: ![](images/169_11.png){width=25%} - Unique spelling. The expected *w*-coil in *wḏȝ* seems to have been confused with as the similarly shaped *wṯz* sign. Compare this spelling from *Esna* IV, 413, 3: ![](images/169_15.png){width=30%}. Cf. @sauneron-2, p. xxxv.

[^fn-169-14]: These divinized supports of the sky, each identified with a cardinal direction, are also listed in *Esna* II, 17, 48-49; [Esna 183], 7-9; cf. @pichel, pp. 123, 129-130 (with notes).
