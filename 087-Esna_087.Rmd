| The Father in the Beginning,  
| who binds seed for gods and men,  
| lord of the two crowns/uraei,  
| ruler of the desert regions,  
| who gives the office to whom he prefers,
|  
| (so that he)[^fn-1] ascends upon his throne,
|     collecting tribute
|     from the entire world,
| the whole world belongs to him in joy,
| while he is the king,  
|     remaining and enduring for eternity,
|     without one who might ever repeat him.

[^fn-1]: The text here appears to switch from praising Khnum-Re to describe the king, who has received his royal legitimacy from the god.
