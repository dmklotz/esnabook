^1^ As for this mound,  
Iunyt is its name.  
It is the place to which Re came,  
and he said to Shu and Tefnut:  
This is your Heliopolis (Iunu) of long ago!  
Thus it is called Iunyt.  
  
[...]  
their majesties.  
It was a desire to go south (*ḫnt*)[^fn-60-0] in her heart.  
Her majesty reached Upper Egyptian Thebes.[^fn-60-1]  
^2^ They said to her (there):  
'Go further south (*ḫnt*) to Iunyt,  
south of the City (Thebes).[^fn-60-2]  
That city belongs to Khnum and Menhyt.'  
Thus one says Esna  
as the name of this district.   
  
Her heart [was glad] about it,  
and she said:  
'I will be there (*ỉm *).'  
Thus the [name] of the [ro]ad  
became This one Truly (*m-mȝʿ.t*)  
until today.

</div>

[^fn-60-0]:  ![](images/60_1.png){width=6%} - @sternberg, p. 70, n. f, suggested multiple readings of this sign, but the most likely is the first choice, *ḫnt*, "to go upstream (south)." This text focuses primarily on Neith's journey south to Esna, ultimately resulting in an etymology for Khent-ta. The crocodile very frequently writes *ḫnt* at Esna.
[^fn-60-1]: In opposition to Lower Egyptian Thebes (*wȝs.t-mḥt*) near Neith's primary temple in Sais: @guermeur-sais.
[^fn-60-2]: Rather than "the southern city (*nỉw.t rsy.t*)", the syntax demands reading "south of the City", a reference to Thebes (the location of this speech) which was often called simple "the City." At the same time, there is an implied pun with the *Rs-n.t* chapel of Neith: cf. [Esna 63], 1; [Esna 84], 1, and eventually "Esna", similar to "*Resno" (south of the city).

She arrived at this mound,  
and thus Neith came about  
protecting their majesties  
in this city.  
She is the southern vulture,  
of the limit (*ḫnt*) of the earth (*tȝ*).[^fn-60-2b]  
Thus came about 'Khent-ta' (*ḫnt-tȝ*)  
as the name of this mound.  

</div>

[^fn-60-2b]: This is apparently an allusion to Nekhbet as a vulture perched at the southern limit of the sky.

Tefnut swalled the diminished, divine eye,[^fn-60-3]  
from a desire to carry out its protection  
from the rebel enemies.  
  
She fled to the Field of Re,  
north of this city.  
  
^4^ Thoth meanwhile hurried  
to the place where she was  
in order to replenish the wedjat-eye  
in her belly:  
so it was filled through his magic (*ḥkȝ*).

</div>

[^fn-60-3]: ![](images/60_2a.png){width=20%}![](images/60_2b.png){width=38%} - Partially following the ingenious reading of @sternberg, pp. 71-72, nn. q-r. However, she understood the two ovals after the wedjat-eye as dual markers, but the following narrative only refers to a single eye. Instead, I understand this as a reference to the new moon, diminished (*ʿnḏ*) and in need of both protection and refilling by Thoth.  The spelling of *nṯr.ty* evokes a very different reading: "and thus the turtle swallowed the *wedjat*-eye (*ʿm štw wḏȝ.t*)", a dangerous cosmic event alluded to with similar hieroglyphs in *Esna* II, 6, 17 and 14 (also involving Thoth and Menhyt). Here the spelling of Tefnut apparently derives *t* < *dwn-ʿ.wy*, "Dewenawy" + *f* + *n < nr.t*, "vulture."

The iris of the Eye of Re arose  
from between her thighs,  
in the form of a scarab beetle,  
with the face of an august child.  
  
One called him Heka (*ḥkȝ*),  
Greatest of Magic (*wr-ḥkȝ*), Ka (*kȝ*) of Re.    
  
Her heart was soothed with this.  
^5^ Neith takes him  
during the festival of Renenutet (Pharmouthi),[^fn-60-4]  
so Shu might embrace him with his arms.  

</div>

[^fn-60-4]: This is the festival of Renenutet, mother of grain, in the final month of summer, leading up to the birth of the divine child days later on [Pachons 1], the beginning of the harvest season.

Then Re said:  
'You are the mother,  
who came about in the beginning:  
may you rejuvenate (*mnḥ*) his body,  
and encircle (*mḥn*) upon his head.'  
Thus she is called 'Menhyt (*Mnḥy.t*).'  
   
His mother took control (*sḫm*)  
over anybody who rebelled against him,  
in her name of 'Sakhmet' (*Sḫm.t*).  
Thus he is called  
'Son of Sakhmet.'  
  
One performs the Divine Birth ritual[^fn-60-5] for him  
in this city.  
Re said to Tefnut:  
'You are my mighty daughter.  
May you serve as Lady of the Field (*nb.t ww*).'  
Thus she is called 'Nebtu (*Nb.t-ww*).'  
  
She goes[^fn-60-6] to the field,  
on the day of the bark procession,  
without [fail], every day.  

</div>

[^fn-60-5]: This is the birth festival for Heka starting on [Pachons 1].
[^fn-60-6]: ![](images/60_5.png){width=10%} - sternberg, pp. 68-69, translated "sie begibt sich (*sḫm=s*)" without comment. In similar contexts, the most frequently used verbs are *ʿq*, "to enter" (e.g. *Esna* III, 197, 21; 340, 5; 346, 21), or *šm*, "to go" (*Esna* III, 340, 5; 346, 20 *bis*). The latter makes the most sense here, probably derived from *šmʿ*, "white crown."

<!-- to add: for the verb mnH, add Kurth/Budde, Studien zur Vokabular? Or Esna VII translation volume, for VII, 43-44 (similar epithet in relation to Menhyt: mnH Haw; same verb seems to occur in Esna 16, 2)-->
