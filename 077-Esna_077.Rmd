[^fn-77-0]: The festival of "lifting up heaven" on Phamenoth 1 is widely attested since the New Kingdom, and most frequently involves the Memphite demiurge Ptah-Tatenen; cf. @berlandini-1995, pp. 29-31. At Esna, this coincided with the major festival of installing the potter's wheel by Khnum-Re-Tatenen: @sauneron-5, pp. 71-88, 81-244; @leitz-loeffler.

[^fn-77-25]: ![](images/77_25.png){width=30%} - @sauneron-5, p. 24, notes m-n, split up this text differently, but noted the toponym with *wȝḥ* might represent a bark station between the temples. As such, the following *p*-sign is likely the determinative to that toponym, a representation of a socle, rather than the definite pronoun for what follows.

Not(?) seen[^fn-77-27] by the Sakhmet priest.  
Making (ritual objects) as "thrown in the water."  

</div>

[^fn-77-26]: For this entire festival, see the more detailed version in *Esna* III, 199, 27-28; cf. @sauneron-5, p. 25, n. b; and the discussion of @quack-water, pp. 9-10. In the lenghtier account, the 4 sacrifical goats are identified with markings with enemies of the king and gods. Finally, wax figures of the enemies are thrown into the water.
[^fn-77-27]: ![](images/77_27.png){width=30%}  - @sauneron-5, p. 24, and @quack-water, p. 9, both understood the first *nw*-pot as a negation, and Quack argued perhaps the Sakhmet priest was not required to inspect these type of animal sacrifices, since the goats are not eaten. However, one of the chief purposes of the Sakhmet priest was to make recognize special markings so people would not accidentally kill sacred animals; moreover, I know of no parallels at Esna for this spelling of a negation. Perhaps the *n* belongs to the former group, or perhaps the former signs should have been *m-rwty* ***n*** *pr pn*.

</div>

[^fn-77-30]: More details of this major festival of Neith occur on the festival columns:  @sauneron-5, pp. 246-308.
[^fn-77-31]: @sauneron-5, p. 26, translated this literally: "Faites accueil à Neith."  However, in the more detailed parallel (*Esna* III, 206, 15, §21), the verb Szp has a sun determinative, and a similar passage earlier in that text (*Esna* III, 206, 14, §18), makes it clear this is actually: "light up (a torch) in front of her" (the last example correctly understood by @sauneron-5, p. 270, n. c; cf. @klotz-baboons, pp. 57-58. This festival celebrates Neith giving birth to Re, hence the light, and torches are carried before her sacred cow in the evening ritual on Epiphi 19 (*Esna* III, 207, 23; @sauneron-5, p. 302, n. a).
[^fn-77-32]: The evening rituals for this black sacred cow, identified with Neith as Mehet-weret, are detailed further in *Esna* III, 207; cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 295-302.
