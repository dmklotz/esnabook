^1^ As for this mound,  
which is to the south  
of Per-Khnum of the Field.  
  
The Great Place[^fn-130-1] is its name [...]  
[...]s that are there [...]  
3 [gods] and 4 [goddesses][^fn-130-2]  
[in] their names:  
  
[Os]iris [the Mighty, Anubis, He who is in Pe],  
Horit, Daughter of Re, Iutu(?),[^fn-130-3] Nebtu.  
  
They are the children of Re,  
guarded and protected within it,  
like the cavern[^fn-130-4] bearing ^2^ the blessed dead.  
  
Their father Re rises  
across from it  
performing the action of mummifying   
[...]  
[...] which is there.  

</div>

[^fn-130-1]: The "Great Place" is mentioned frequently in the calendars and related festival texts. It is the abaton for the deceased gods, the children of Re, near the temple of Khnum-Re Lord of the Field in North Esna.
[^fn-130-2]: This restoration is suggested by @sauneron-2, p. 251, notes a-b. As he mentions, the same list of divinities are listed among the blessed dead who praise Neith north of Esna in the great hymn [Esna 163], 27; and they even receive offerings in *Esna* VII, 613, along with their father Re-Harakhty. Since this is a group of 7 ancestor deities, it is unclear whether they are identical with the 7 Djaisu of Methyer, also said to be buried north of Esna. 
[^fn-130-3]: ![](images/130_1.png){width=11%} - The precise reading of this name is tricky; it appears identically in [Esna 163], 27, and similarly in *Esna* VII, 613, 27: ![](images/130_1b.png){width=12%}. The first sign elsewhere writes *ỉwty* (e.g. *Esna* III, 263, 24) and *ʿȝ* (e.g. [Esna 162], 4; *Esna* 277, 23 [7]). I prefer to interpret her name as the opposite of her companion, Nebtu: "she without a field", "lady of the field." But since this is admittedly a poor divine epithet, "Great One of the Field (*ʿȝ.t-ww*)" should also be considered.
[^fn-130-4]: This would seem to be the prototypical Egyptian abaton, the cavern in Helopolis, burial place of the children of Re.

He is Thoth, delighting their hearts  
[...]  
[j]oining the 8 gods.  
One says [to] him:  
'Be gracious!'  
Thus he is called  
the Guard of the 8th Day.[^fn-130-5]  
  
^3^ He [...] them in jubilation,  
their hearts are cooled therein.  
  
One may not shout within this mound,  
one may not wear sandals[^fn-130-5a] within it,  
whoever enters it [...]  
[...of] 1 [day];[^fn-130-6]  
one may not wear ram-skin(?)[^fn-130-7] in it,  
in the upper part [...]  
  
[...]  
magnifying the great gods  
who rest within it.  
The divine water is there [...]  

</div>

[^fn-130-5]: Distinct from "the Guard of Day 9" mentioned in [Esna 129], 2.
[^fn-130-5a]: ![](images/130_2.png){width=15%} - Such a prohibition is not mentioned elsewhere, but an injunction against wearing leather sandals makes sense, especially with the possible mention of animal skin clothing later. Cf. @sauneron-5, p. 342, n. f, for an interesting later parallel.
[^fn-130-6]: Restore after *Esna* III, 197, 16: "all men should be purified from women for a purification of 1 day (*m wʿb nt hrw wʿ*)"; cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 340-341, with n. a.
[^fn-130-7]: ![](images/130_3.png){width=15%} - This word is spelled like srp.t, "lotus blossom", but the determinative would not fit here. Rather, this seems to be a variant of a similar text concerning North Esna, which forbids men to wear "skin of a ram" (*šny n* ***sr***: ![](images/130_3a.png){width=16%} ) when entering the temple: *Esna* III, 197, 17; cf. @sauneron-5, p. 342, n. f. Perhaps the final *p* and *t* in the present inscription are errors for the animal skin determinative present in the latter text.

^4^ Now this other mound,  
to the north of Per-Khnum of the Field:  
  
It is *ỉmy-wȝḏ=s*,  
its name is also 'Mound of the Great Gold',[^fn-130-9]  
in oral tradition.  
  
Tefnut stopped upon it,  
as a uraeus within   
a papyrus thicket of *gnš*-plants,  
to hide herself from the gods.  
  
Then Re came [...]  
[...]  
^5^ [...] this papyrus thicket.  
  
Then Re said:  
'It is nice in the papyrus thicket!'[^fn-130-10]  
Thus one says *ỉmy-wȝḏ=s*  
as the name of this mound.  
  
Then [Re] said to [Te]f[nut]:[^fn-130-11]  
[...] gold [...]  
[...] like [Re] eternally.

</div>

[^fn-130-9]: As @sauneron-2, p. 241, n. e, pointed out, this same mound is mentioned in *Esna* 197, 20 (on column 1, immediately inside the door from the present text), and 241, 11.
[^fn-130-10]: ![](images/130_5.png){width=25%} - The syntax is unusual, but this appears to be a way of linking Re's speech (*(ỉ)m wȝḏ s(t)*) with the name of the mound (*ỉmy-wȝḏ=s*).
[^fn-130-11]: Since the following section mentions "gold", presumably Re's second speech gave an etymology for the alternate name, "Mound of the Great Gold."
