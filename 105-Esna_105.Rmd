| ^1^ The good wind of the south:
|   Sheheb is his name.[^fn-105-1]
| 
| ^2^ It is he who lifts the bas of the gods 
|   ^3^ up to the sky.
| As he made the crocodile enter 
|    into ^4^ the right-eye,[^fn-105-2] 
| so he made Hapi come forth from the grotto
|   to flood Iunyt with food and provisions.
|   
| ^5^ Come! Be peaceful!
| Act kindly for Iunyt!
| ^6^ To you belongs all that comes 
|    from the ^7^ southern Hapi.
| 
| Blow in as the wind!
| Hurry [...!]
| [...] ^8^ the temple of Khnum
|   of the Father in the Beginning,
|     having uniting with his nose.

[^fn-105-1]: For this manifestation of the south-wind, see *LGG* VII, 111a-b and 458a; @riggs-soter, pp. 317-320 (both with references). The first lines of this text find exact parallels in the Ptolemaic chapel of Hathor, *Deir el-Médinâ* 112, 3. Based on those other versions, this figure can be restored as a lion with a ram head and four wings; this same figure appears without caption in the astronomical ceiling: *Esna* IV, 451, 7 (East) (noted by Daniel Arpagaus, personal communication).  The eastern wind appears in a symmetric scene [Esna 128].
<!--also add notes to Panehemise when possible -->
[^fn-105-2]: Darniel Arpagaus (personal communication) suggested this obscure reference might be illustrated on the astronomical ceiling of Esna ([Esna IV, 451](https://www.ifao.egnet.net/uploads/publications/enligne/Temples-Esna004.pdf#page121){target="_blank"}). In the eastern side, the south-wind faces a crocodile with the head of a cobra for a tail. The precise astrological significance of this phrase and scene remains obscure to me.
