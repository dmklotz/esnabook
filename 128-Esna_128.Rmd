 up to the sky in the time/area ^3^ of [...]  
 to illumine Egypt in radiance.

[...] he in [...]  
^5^ he [...] the temple   
  of the Lord of the Potter's wheel,

Ptah lives ^6^ from his wind  
  his [scent] is sweet as the wind [...]

[^fn-128-1]: For this manifestation of the east wind, see *LGG* IV, 806a-b; @riggs-soter, pp. 317-320 (both with references). The first lines of this text can be restored after the close parallel in the Ptolemaic chapel of Hathor, *Deir el-Médinâ* 112, 2. Based on those other versions, this figure can be restored as a scarab with a ram head and four wings, as also depicted on the astronomical ceiling: *Esna* IV, 401 C (East). The southern wind appears in a symmetric scene [Esna 105].
