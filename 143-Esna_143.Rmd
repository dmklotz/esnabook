^1^ The *Mtr* water,[^fn-143-0]  
   ^2^ he renews at his time.  
^3^ Words spoken:  
  
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
(Autokrator Caesar)  
has come before you,  
Neith [^fn-143-1] the great, Mother of God,  
Lady of Esna.  
  
He brings to you the [precise] water  
  who corrects the fields,  
he travels [for you]  
^4^ [As he settl]ed [upon the ban]ks,  
he flooded the two lands with your beauty,  
  to make flourish bread offerings  
    for the gods.  
    
You are the good father,  
who watches over [what comes from] her[^fn-143-2],  
an effective mother,  
good at nurturing.  
  
</div>  
  
[^fn-143-0]: The Hapi called *Mtr* occurs in numerous temples; cf. @tattko-2014, pp. 374-377. It's listed as one category of inundation already in New Kingdom onomastica: Gardiner, *AEO*. 
[^fn-143-1]: ![](images/143_1.png){width=10%} - This same spelling of Neith occurs fairly often at Esna, particularly in other Hapi scenes: >>. It is an allusion to her form as the primeval *ḏ*-serpent, sometimes called *ḏ.t*, "Eternity." Cf. @klotz-caesar, p. 174.  
[^fn-143-2]: ![](images/143_2.png){width=35%} - Other restorations are possible.
