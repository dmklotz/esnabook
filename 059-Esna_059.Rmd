^1^ Live the good god,  
fashioned by Khnum,  
  in the moment of pleasing the heart,  
heir of the Potter,  
(Domitian[^fn-59-1] Augustus)  
He says to his august father,  
  Khnum-Re, Lord of Esna,  
  august power,  
  beautiful of appearance,  
  great of plans,  
  who begets gods and men,  
  breath of life  
    for whomever calls[^fn-59-2] to his Ka:  
    
I am he whose body lives,  
  who emerged upon your potter's wheel,  
my plans came about   
  through the command of your Ka.  
  
Come in peace!  
Enter your temple

"(It is), meanwhile, the mound  
  from which you birthed the primeval ones,  
  you began life for the earth within it.  
    
"(It is) the stable of life,[^fn-59-3]  
  on which you joined your *serekh*,  
your sister, moreover,[^fn-59-4] is with you,  
the gods within it are in joy.  
  
"May you see the statues I made  
  for your temple,  
and receive it all from my hand.  
  
"Your priest is present [^fn-59-5],

[^fn-59-1]: ![](images/59_1.png){width=25%} - This spelling is notable. The arm with water (traditionally: *ỉʿ*, "to wash") represents the medial vowels in "Domit***ia***n." The two kings do not write *nsw-bỉty*, but: *n* < ("red crown") + *s* < *sṯn* (acrophony).  
  
[^fn-59-2]: ![](images/59_2.png){width=10%} - Unusual spelling of this verb. For the phonetic change, cf. @kurth-1, p. 532.  
  
[^fn-59-3]: This phrase, originally "stable of goats (*ʿnḫ.w*)", usually designates a mammisi; cf. @klotz-caesar, p. 266, n. 270. In *Esna* II, 31, 61, this term designates the Temple of the Chicks, aka Per-Sahure, also identified with the primeval mound of creation. At *Edfou* III, 159, 5, however, it clearly designates the royal palace, which makes the most sense here.

[^fn-59-4]: ![](images/59_3.png){width=8%} - Reading suggested from the context. Acrophony: *ỉs* = *ỉ* < *ỉp.t*, "hippopotamus" (@meeks-delta, p. 100, n. 282) +  *s* < *sḫmty*, "double crown" (@sauneron-8, p. 174).  
  
[^fn-59-5]: For this verb at Esna, cf. @sauneron-rde15, pp. 49-51 (translating this example on p. 50).
