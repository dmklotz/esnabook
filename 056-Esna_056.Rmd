[^fn-56-1]: This is all an allusion to the parallel scenes [Esna 52] and [Esna 74], in which the king "leaves the palace", wearing the double-plumed crown characteristic of Khnum-Tatenen.

[^fn-56-2]: ![](images/56_1.png){width=15%} - This might alternatively write "(his) father, Nun."

[^fn-56-3]: For this epithet, Sauneron cites [Esna 74], 12. This refers to Horus and Thoth, who purify the king before he meets Khnum and Menhyt in [Esna 67].

[^fn-56-4]: Wadjyt and Nekhbet, as depicted accompanying the king in [Esna 70].

[^fn-56-5]: ![](images/56_4.png){width=10%} - This reading is confirmed by [Esna 157 B], which is paralleled by a regular spelling in *Esna* III, 242, 23 (58); another example occurs in *Esna* III, 243, 9, where Khnum is identified as the serpentine Kematef.

[^fn-56-6]: ![](images/56_2.png){width=10%} - @kurth-1, p. 312, n. 138, cites this example as a unique spelling of the lotus bud for *r*.

[^fn-56-7]: ![](images/56_3.png){width=8%} - Note the spelling, appropriate for the statue of Khnum within his shrine, and reveals the contemporary pronunciation (cf. Coptic ⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ).
