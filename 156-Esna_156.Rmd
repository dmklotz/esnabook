[^fn-156-1]: ![](images/156_1.png){width=10%} - This seems to be an orthographic variant of *mẖr.t*, "granary; storehouse", which also houses cows in [Esna 155], 4.
[^fn-156-2]: ![](images/156_2.png){width=10%} - This term does not seem to be related to *thm*, "to round up; incite" (*Wb* V, 321, 6-14).

[^fn-156-4]: ![](images/156_4.png){width=15%} - For this epithet, see primarily @budde-himmel.
[^fn-156-5]: ![](images/156_5.png){width=12%} - As @sauneron-2, p. 271, n. a, noted, the word "Ka" is here spelled with the number 4, just as in [Esna 191], 19. The spelling derives from the proverbial Four Kas of Ptah: @sauneron-rde15, pp. 60-61; @meeks-ka.
[^fn-156-6]: For the residents of the Duat reversing positions upon the arrival of the solar god, see also [Esna 163], 26.

You are the sweet father

Very mysterious,  
very hidden:  
it cannot be known by any people,

</div>

[^fn-156-7]: When Khnum-Shu enters the Temple of the Bas in North Esna, he usually brings the breath of life to the deceased ancestors: e.g. *Esna* III, 196, 11.
[^fn-156-8]: ![](images/156_7.png){width=15%} - Reading uncertain, but since the context refers to Khnum-Shu entering the necropolis of North Esna to give breath to the deceased, presumably this goddess should be Nebtu. The knife elsewhere writes both *n* and *m* (@sauneron-8, pp. 192-193), and this value might derive from *nm*, "knife" (*Wb* II, 263, 10).
[^fn-156-9]: ![](images/156_6.png){width=15%} - The *wṯz* sign is a mistake for *wḏȝ* (cf. @sauneron-2, p. xxxv), as confirmed from other examples of this phrase: [Esna 127], 10; *Esna* III, 196, 8; 197, 21.
[^fn-156-10]: Compare similar descriptions of the secret, divine mound at North Esna: [Esna 81], 2; [Esna 127], 9-10.

Your corpse is hidden,  
your place is kept sacred.  
It is a dwelling[^fn-156-12a] for your Majesty,  
in which you reside.  
You do not stray for Esna,  
which your heart loves,  
the place of 'roaming the marshes'   
for your Ka.  
  
You find the ^21^ very great pronaos,  
equipped with papyriform columns,  
extending to meet your Majesty,  
like a papyrus thicket you travel to behold.[^fn-156-12b]  
You reached Egypt in [...] a second time,  
in a single night.[^fn-156-12c]  
  
Its likeness  
is like the replica in it,  
like that which is within it.[^fn-156-12]  
  
Their basins are overflowing  
with fish and fowl;  
all pastures(?)[^fn-156-13] are equipped  
with bulls and cows,  
in all forms of a god.[^fn-156-14]

</div>

[^fn-156-12a]: For Esna as the *pr-hyn* for Khnum, see *Esna* III, 377, 8; *Esna* IV, 431, 3: @klotz-baboons, p. 44, n. a.
[^fn-156-12b]: Similar phrases to describe the pronaos in [Esna 155], 1; [Esna 190], 1.
[^fn-156-12c]: Yet another allusion to Khnum journeying between Esna and Chemmis overnight.
[^fn-156-12]: Same gnomic set of statements in [Esna 176], 4-5; [Esna 190], 2; [Esna 191], 21; similarly [Esna 155], 3. From these texts, it seems to refer to Esna being a copy of Chemmis, perhaps containing a microcosm of Chemmis within it.
[^fn-156-13]: ![](images/156_8.png){width=15%} - The same term occurs in a similar context in [Esna 191], 21. The present translation follows the suggestion by @sauneron-1, p. 63, n. a, which fits the general context.
[^fn-156-14]: Here begins another list of sacred bulls and cows, each linked to specific divinities. See also [Esna 190], 3-10; [Esna 191], 22-27. As in the other lists, most of the bovine names are uniquely attested here, and it is often difficult to propose a transliteration, or even determine whether it is a cow or bull. Toward the end of this text, we also see the titles or nicknames for various herdsmen linked to specific types of cattle.

</div>

[^fn-156-15]: The same god is mentioned in [Esna 190], 5, but with a different sacred animal.
[^fn-156-16]: Amidst this seemingly random list of sacred bulls and cows, the Buchis bull was revered north of Esna in Armant, where Tjenenet was the chief goddess. Remarkably, Bucheum Stela 9 records an event where a special bull was recognized as a possible Buchis in Asfun, and brought specifically to Esna for inspection. Did this city, home of Khnum Lord of the Field and Chief of the Herdsmen, have a monopoly on sacred cattle?
[^fn-156-17]: ![](images/156_9.png){width=18%} - Noteworthy spelling of "Shu", with the elaborate bark write *w* < *wỉȝ*.
[^fn-156-18]: ![](images/156_10.png){width=15%} - Uncertain how to transliterate this name. Possibly *bnr.ty* or *mȝmȝ*, based on two words for palm trees.

[^fn-156-19]: This is apparenly a military or aulic title referring to generals or other high-ranking Egyptians: cf. *PWL*, p. 699. In the present text it seems to designate elite herdsmen.

[^fn-156-20]: ![](images/156_11.png){width=18%} - The restoration makes sense in the context, since this is a popular epithet for Khnum-Shu: *LGG* VI, 210b-c.
