[^fn-82-1]: Royal and divine epithet, difficult to translate (lit. "chief of the cultivable areas near the river banks"), often associated with Shu as provider of divine offerings, and thus also appropriate to Khnum Lord of the Field. Cf. @inconnu.

[^fn-82-2]: ![](images/82_1.png){width=25%} - Reading uncertain. Presumably the king is telling Khnum he is his child, as in the symmetric scene [Esna 59], 1: "I am he whose body is alive, who came forth upon your potter's wheel."

[^fn-82-3]: ![](images/82_2.png){width=8%} - The correct transliteration is confirmed by *Esna* II, 4, 11.

[^fn-82-4]: Tentatively restored after the similar parallel in *Esna* VII, 642, although this could easily refer to a different toponym.
