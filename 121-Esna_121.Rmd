| Live the good god,
| who established rituals
|   in the Temple of the Father,
| whose mouth is firm [^fn-121-0]
|   upon (saying) what is excellent; 
| it is his perfection that provisions [^fn-121-1] offerings
|   at its proper time,[^fn-121-2]
| and transfigures his Ka upon the altar,
|   enduring for all eternity.

[^fn-121-0]: In *Esna* II, 4, 12, Khnum grants the king "mouths are firm (*rȝ.w rwḏ.w*) recalling your perfection (*(ḥr) sḫȝ nfrw=k*)."

[^fn-121-1]: ![](images/121_1.png){width=15%} - @vadas-2020, p. 95, split this group into two words ("the supplier who created") but the alighting bird is just a determinative for this verb, a variant of the usual *dfA* bird. Cf. DZA 29.884.780-790; *Esna* III, 222 A; *Esna* VII, 584, 5; 600, 12.

[^fn-121-2]: ![](images/121_2.png){width=15%} - @vadas-2020, p. 95, with n. 16, translated "his brightness (*jwn=f*)." However, this is the adverbial phrase "at his moment (*r* (< *jw*) *nw=f*)", which occurs frequently at Esna. So also in [Esna 125], 2, which @vadas-2020, p. 98, n. 41, translated as *r ntf*, "so that he."
