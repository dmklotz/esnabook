^1^ The good god,  
second of *swȝḏ-bȝ*,  
third of Heh of Heh-gods,[^fn-176-1]   
who supports the sky,  
who el[evates] the place of Re,  
[...] and grasps the Heh-gods.  
  
Shu is lifting up Nut for his father,    
having established the pillars  
bearing the firmament;  
establishing it for his Ka,  
like the great Akhet  
holding the two orbiters (sun and moon);  
raising up his image,  
foremost of the Ennead:  
all faces see from the power of his majesty.  
  
He made sacred the secret image  
of his august father.

</div>

[^fn-176-1]: Two standard epithet of Shu, used particularly in his role of supporting the sky. They are both associated with columns from the pronaos in [Esna 162], 5-6. For *swȝḏ-bȝ*, see *LGG* VI, 210b-c.

^2^ This papyriform hypostyle hall  
is established here before you,  
Khnum Tatenen,  
father of the gods.  
  
^3^ It is the bushes of Chemmis,  
which you enter in joy,  
^4^ your heart gladdens   
to see its four corners.  
  
Its likeness,  
which it is,  
^5^ which is within in it,
all of its forms are of its likeness.[^fn-176-1b]

</div>

[^fn-176-1b]: Based on similar passages on other columns (e.g. [Esna 155], 3), this gnomic statement seems to claim that every part of the papyriform hypostyle pronaos at Esna is the exact replica of the marshes of Chemmis.

(Its) fields[^fn-176-9] are great,  
^6^ its plants are large,  
its grain[^fn-176-9b] is scintillating,  
containing all flowers.  
  
^7^ This papyrus thicket (*mnḥ*),[^fn-176-10]  
in which you rest,  
Menhyt (*Mnḥyt*) the uraeus (*mḥn*) is on your brow,  
and its flowers [sp]arkle before you.  
  
This papyrus marsh,  
is spread out to meet your majesty.  
  
^8^ Behold[^fn-176-11] its plants!  
namely a lotus at your nose,  
your heart delights from its fragrance,  
you unite with its scent,  
and you are happy  
from seeing its beauty.

</div>

[^fn-176-9]: A similar word is recorded in *Wb* II 147, 5, but that appears to be a marsh or body of water. The present term seems to be derived from *sḫ.t*, "field"; see also [Esna 155], 4.
[^fn-176-9b]: ![](images/176_2.png){width=15%} - Notable spelling of *npry*, for which one may compare the Coptic derivative ⲛⲁⲫⲣⲓ. Similar spellings are attested as early as the First Intermediate Period: cf. @vernus-form; and see also [Esna 155], 4.
[^fn-176-10]: A number of these plant names occur in the similar dedication text ([Esna 183]), as well as a longer scene of offering papyrus: *Esna* III, 292, 23-24; @sauneron-5, p. 140.  For the *mnḥ*-plant, see @sauneron-bifao64, pp. 1-2. 
[^fn-176-11]: ![](images/176_1.png){width=10%} - Unique sign, which I assume is a variant of the bed to write *mk*, "to protect."

It is a papyrus mat,  
rolled open before you![^fn-176-12]  
Its plants are born  
all around ^9^ and anew.  
  
Its color is gold,  
its leaves are true lapis lazuli:  
your eyes are astonished[^fn-176-13]   
whenever you come to it!  

</div>

[^fn-176-12]: For *psš.t*, see *Wb* I, 555, 1. The verb matched to this term via alliteration (*prḫ*) can also mean "to blossom", so one might understand this phrase differently: "it is a *psš*-plant blossoming before you."
[^fn-176-13]: For this passage, and the reading of the terms (*gȝ*, "to stare in astonishment," not *ptr*, "to behold"), see @sauneron-61, p. 241.

It is protected,  
it is removed from impurity,  
it is purified for all evil things;  
^10^ enemies are released  
from whomever comes to reach it;  
sickness is healed  
for whomever makes a pilgrimage to it.  
  
They (the pillars) meanwhile, lift up,  
resembling the very sky,  
like Shu supporting Nut,  
remaining, enduring, eternally.[^fn-176-14]
