^1^ As for this mound,  
Esna is its name.  
it is the district of Neith  
in Upper Egypt in the West.  
  
A copy of her Neith nome  
in Lower Egypt in the East.  
  
She is the Mother of Re,  
when she came with him  
to this city.  
  
He joined his creator,  
Ptah-Tatenen  
within the Southern District,  
in his name of   
Great Khnum, Father of Fathers.  
  
She found this mound  
within the *n.t*-waters,  
and she made her seat (*s.t*) there.  
^2^ Thus one says 'Esna'[^fn-81-1]  
as the name of this district.  

</div>

[^fn-81-1]: ![](images/81_1.png){width=25%} - That is: "the seat of the *n.t*-waters".

Her majesty went north of this city,[^fn-81-2]  
Per-Khnum of the Field is its name.  
  
It is a divine mound,  
without its like,[^fn-81-3]  
sanctified and great,  
foremost of cities and districts.  
  
No animal should tread over it;  
if a woman approaches it,  
disaster will befall the whole world.[^fn-81-4]   
  
  
It is the palace which came about [...]   
entire [...]  
^3^ [...] the great god in the first time.  
The crypt is in it,  
the place of hiding the condition[^fn-81-5]  
of Osiris[^fn-81-5b] of Neb-Ankh,  
along with the great Djaisu of Mehet-weret,  
who are hidden within it.

[^fn-81-2]: Neith journeys north of Esna to Per-Khnum in her great hymn: [Esna 163], 26ff.
[^fn-81-3]: Same qualifications in [Esna 163], 26.
[^fn-81-4]: Very similar, misogynistic parallel describing Per-netjer in [Esna 127], 10; [Esna 156], 20; *Esna* III, 196, 2, and elsewhere.
[^fn-81-5]: Cf. [Esna 129], 3.
[^fn-81-5b]: ![](images/81_0a.png){width=5%}![](images/81_0b.png){width=10%} - Note the spelling of Osiris, with initial *w* derived from *ww*, "cultivated area", and thus linked to the visit by Isis-Nebtu to the fields and this necropolis described later on. Same spelling in [Esna 110], 7; [Esna 163], 20.

She protects his son, Re, therein,  
as well as [^fn-81-6a] his son Shu,

^4^ Tefnut stopped at this city,  
on her return from Kenset (Nubia),  
she saw her brother as the Lord of Strength,  
within this good field.  
She made her transformation [into ...][^fn-81-7]  
  
[...] entirely [...]  
he is therein,  
he made the *wrh*-dance ^5^ for her,  
he elevated her Majesty,

</div>

[^fn-81-6a]: ![](images/81_3.png){width=5%} - Reading suggested by @sternberg, p. 91, n. p. This might alternatively write *prỉ*, "to come forth", alluding to Shu rushing to his father's defense in North Esna.
[^fn-81-6]: In more detailed accounts ([Esna 129], *Esna* III, 192), Khnum-Shu the Good Protector is the hero who destroyes the enemies of Re. In this version, centered initially around Neith, the goddess plays the active role.
[^fn-81-7]: An allusion to the Myth of the Wandering Goddess. Here Tefnut reaches North Esna, sees Khnum-Shu as a mighty warrior (i.e. Onuris), and she transforms into the kindly, human-faced Nebtu. Since the text later describes the festival of Khnum at North Esna on 1 Khoiak, this also relates to Nebtu's visit there on the same occasion; cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 58-60.
[^fn-81-8]: The famous *wrh*-dance of Shu for Tefnut-Menhyt-Nebtu at Esna takes place specifically at North Esna during the festival of 1 Khoiak: cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 60-62. A similar phrase occurs in a description of that festival: *Esna* III, 346, 23 (*ỉr=f n=s wrh, sqȝ=f ḥm=s*).

Then his majesty was justified,  
in all his trials,  
and they caused suffering,   
at her command,  
in his [good] festival [of the Decision][^fn-81-9].  
[The gods of cities and] districts,[^fn-81-10]  
their hearts are pleased,  
one comes to see him in justification,  
  
[...] in jubilation,  
in this good festival,  
of IV Akhet Day 1 (= 1/30),  
in the festival of Khoiak,[^fn-81-11]  
^6^ also called 'the great *wpy*-festival'  
[...]  
seeing the beauty of the two disks.[^fn-81-12]

</div>

[^fn-81-9]: ![](images/81_2.png){width=20%} - Emended after close parallels in [Esna 127], 8; *Esna* III, 337 B; 346, 22. For the "festival of the decision" which also coincided with 1 Khoiak, see @sauneron-5, pp. 63-65.
[^fn-81-10]: Restored after *Esna* III, 337 B; 346, 22.
[^fn-81-11]: For references to the "great *wpy*-festival" of 1 Khoiak, named after the "judgement (*wp.t*)," see @klotz-baboons, p. 55, n. 118 (correct the interpretation of the date given there, where I did not recognize the fractional notation).
[^fn-81-12]: Presumably Shu and Tefnut. See in the same festival context *Esna* III, 346, 22; and [Esna 80], 3; [Esna 127], 9,

The field is radiant [...]

The good field is overwhelmed  
from the *wpy*-festival.[^fn-81-14]  
Esna celebrates,  
Per-netjer rejoices,  
the Temple of the Chicks is delighted,  
without fail, every day.  

</div>

[^fn-81-13]: These are the great scents of the revitalized field (*sḫ.t-nfr.t*) of North Esna after Khnum-Shu and Nebtu enter it: cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 59-60. Presumably the masculine pronoun "his" refers to Per-netjer, or possibly Khnum-Shu.
[^fn-81-14]: Exact parallel in a hymn to Khnum-Shu and Nebtu on 1 Khoiak: *Esna* III, 346, 24; also 351 B. For the term *grgb*, see *Wb* V, 190, 8.
