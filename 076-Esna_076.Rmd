(Domit[ian...])|  
I have come before you,

I bring to you all good things  
which come forth from your field (*ww*).  
All flowers,  
which emerge from the field (*sḫ.t*).  
^4^ All marsh plants, all greenery,  
plants which flood the cultivated areas:  
all that comes forth from the earth  
is brought here for your Ka.  
  
You are the Lady of the Field (*ww*),  
scintillating of plants,  
you follow your heart in the papyrus marsh.

^5^ Hapi of Lower Egypt,  
who floods ^6^ the lagoons within it  
with fish.  
  
^7^ Words spoken:  
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt  
(Autokr[ator]...)|  
has come [before you],  
[Neith the great, Mother of God],  
[Lady of E]sna.  
  
He brings to you Hapi of Lower Egypt,  
with what is in him,  
the divine water which came from Senmet(?).[^fn-76-1]  
  
[...]   
who magnifies Nun,  
and makes life for those upon earth.

</div>

[^fn-76-1]: Unless this is restored differently, this would refer to the southern origin of the Nile in Biggeh Island, near Aswan.

^9^ Nun[^fn-76-2] ^10^ as he arrives   
at his time.  
  
^11^ Words spoken:  
The Son of Re     
(Domit[ian...])|    
[has come before you],    
[Neith the great, Mother of God],    
[Lady of Esna].   
  
He brings to you Nun,  
[as?] Wenshepsef,[^fn-76-3]  
bearing the great gods[^fn-76-4]  
which come forth [from ...]  
[...]   
   
[You are ...] the uraeus,    
who arose from Nun.  
The mysterious one   
who created all that is.  
  
</div>

[^fn-76-2]: ![](images/76_1.png){width=10%} - A trio of crocodiles frequently substitutes for the expected triple water signs in this and other words. 
[^fn-76-3]: This god was linked to Diospolis Parva in Upper Egypt, and seems to have been a form of Osiris who rejuvenates like the phoenix: *LGG* II, 379b.
[^fn-76-4]: ![](images/76_2.png){width=15%} - Just as in the spelling of Nun, this could alternatively write "great waters (*mw wr.w*)."

^15^ Words spoken:  
The King of Upper and Lower Egypt  
(Autokrator Caesar)|  
has come before you,  
Neith the great, Mother of God,[^fn-76-5]  
Lady of Esna.[^fn-76-6]  
  
He brings to you *ỉṯ-kȝ*,  
^16^ carrying what comes forth from him,  
you rejoice from what you had poured out,  
he magnifies plants before your eyes.  
  
You are she who pours out[^fn-76-7] Hapi from his grotto  
in order to flood the two lands,  
the field flourishes from what you poured out.  
  
</div>

[^fn-76-5]: ![](images/76_3.png){width=30%} - The spelling of Neith evokes the legend of Methyer and Re, since it consists of: the child (*n* < *nww*) + the mother (*t* < *tmȝ.t*). The use of the hippo to write "mother" seems unique (@kurth-1, p. 177, n. 682, cites only this example). Elsewhere, the same sign writes *wr.t* (< Ta-weret) in the name "Neith the Great (*N.t* ***wr.t***): *Esna* IV, 461, S; 463, S.
[^fn-76-6]: ![](images/76_4.png){width=35%} - Remarkable spelling of this epithet using all rams, recalling the Ram Hymn of [Esna 103]. Most elements occur elsewhere, except perhaps the second ram for *tȝ*. Presumably this is derived from *ṯȝy*, "male."
[^fn-76-7]: A similar spelling of this verb occurs in [Esna 184], 12.
