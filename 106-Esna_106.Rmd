^1^ While Iunyt is formed in the design    
  of the double firmaments,   
the solar course[^fn-106-1] is within it  
and He-who-shines-as-gold shines[^fn-106-2] for it.  
  
The august[^fn-106-3] child,  
who ros[e] from the Ihet cow,  
at the beginning of dawn,  
as the beautiful disk of Tatenen,  
whose rays distinguish[...]  
[...] him,  
as Atum, foremost of Manu.

^2^ His right and left eye    
are united therein,   
the divine eyes rise  
before their lord,  
awakening all who are sleeping.  
   
The Ba sacred of form,  
as the four winds,  
they come forth   
  at the name of his majesty,  
and [one] breathes from his [no]strils,  
to the circuit of the sundisk.

^3^ His good sister  
  makes commands in heaven  
  during her year,  
the Mistress of the Decan stars:  
all things come to pass  
according to what they say.[^fn-106-4]  
  
Their Akhet is within Iunyt.  
The Pillar (*ỉwn*) is in it[^fn-106-5],  
  [as he] travels toward the Akhet.  
    
Their favorite place,  
more excellent than heaven.  
  
It is the initial mound [...]

[^fn-106-4]: An astrological concept. The decan stars determine all things that happen on earth.
[^fn-106-5]: ![](images/106_3.png){width=25%} - In @klotz-baboons, pp. 49-50, I had discussed possible readings for this passage. Since there are problems with both interpretations suggested there, I am now inclined to see yet another example of 'banal acrophony' here, with the cartouche writing *m* < *mnš*, "cartouche"; cf. @sauneron-8, pp. 182, 193.
