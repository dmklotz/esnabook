lord of the double plumes,  
he is the Ba who made the gods.  
  
^13^ His head [^fn-70-2] arose   
  while the earth was mixed in darkness,  
his eyes illumined the two lands.[^fn-70-3]  
  
^14^ He who builds people and fashions gods,  
  all animals likewise,  
all things came about through his hands,  
^15^ he united the entire land  
  upon his potter's wheel.  
  
Life, through whom one lives,  
whose utterance is the breath of life,  
^16^ Amun the great,   
who came about in the beginning,  
who made heaven, earth, Duat,   
  waters and mountains:[^fn-70-4]  
    (in short) Great God within Iunyt.  
  
^17^ I give you the south as far as the wind,  
  the north as far as the water,  
all lands kiss the earth for your power.

[^fn-70-0]: Wadjet uses the archaizing form of the second person masculine singular dependent pronoun *k(w)*, instead of *tw/ṯw*. Cf. @vernus-brown, pp. 208-213.  
  
[^fn-70-1]: ![](images/70_1.png){width=15%} - A notable heraldic spelling of *pʿ.t rḫy.t*, confirmed by a fuller writing in [Esna 191],11:  
![](images/70_4.png){width=25%}.   
The first sign is relatively common, but the latter has not been registered before. Typically, a person holding a small bird or goose writes *zȝw*, "Sais" (@kurth-1, p. 132, 25e). The current phonetic value is apparently derived from two geese in the word *rḫ.ty*, "washers" (Wb II, 448, 9-11). A similar goose appears in this word in Esna IV, 416, 2: ![](images/70_3.png){width=18%}  
  
[^fn-70-2]: ![](images/70_2.png){width=15%} - Elsewhere at Esna, a similar animal head typically writes *ȝ.t*, "moment." This is most likely a hippopotamus head, which elsewhere writes *Dp*, "Buto", via substitution with the human head (@klotz-philae, p. 104, n. 136).  
  
[^fn-70-3]: The same cosmic event, the initial creation of light by Khnum, is described in greater detail in *Esna* II 17, 12-15, with a direct parallel to this text: "while the earth was mixed in darkness (*ỉw tȝ ȝbḫ(.w) m zmȝwy*) (...) he opened his eyes, and light came into being immediately (*ptḥ.n=f ỉr.ty=f ḫpr wyn ḥr-ʿ*); cf. @pichel, pp. 34-39.  The text previously mentioned Kematef, the first serpent god who remains in Nun; his successor, Irita, is typically the one who rises from Nun, head first, to create light and solidify the earth: @klotz-caesar, pp. 122-125. Just like Amun in Thebes, Khnum at Esna embodied both "generations" of the creator.  
  
[^fn-70-4]: Typical epithets of Amun in the Graeco-Roman period, who is usually "lord" of this list of celestial regions: @klotz-caesar, p. 60, with n. 104. Applied to Amun elewhere at *Esna* II, 25, 8-9; *Esna* VI, 487, 10-11; 518, 8-9.
